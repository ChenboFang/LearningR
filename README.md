# LearningR
LearningR is a unique tour for myself as a way to record my learning path.
Everyone is warmly welcomed to comment and using this repo as a learning resource.
It is a great honour for me if anyone can give me some guidance or suggestions along the way to learningR.
I will update the repo on a weekly basis.
